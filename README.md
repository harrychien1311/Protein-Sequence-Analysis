# Protein Sequence extraction result analysis
In this repo, I analyzed the protein sequence extracted by using 2 tools Javelin and Skeleton-productions of [Bionsight](https://www.bionsight.com/platform/).
 Based on the analyzed result I can conclude which tool gave a better performance in finding protein sequence.
